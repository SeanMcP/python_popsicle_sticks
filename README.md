# Python Popsicle Sticks

This is a Python/Flask API for the [Popsicle Sticks app](https://github.com/SeanMcP/popsicle-sticks).

This API takes some inspiration from [Auth0's](https://auth0.com) ["Developing RESTful APIs with Python and Flask"](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/) tutorial.
